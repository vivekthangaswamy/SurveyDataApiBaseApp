# Setting up Key Vault in the Surveys app

This doc shows how to store application secrets/certificate for the Surveys app in Azure Key Vault.
It is good if every secret is kept on Key Vault, for example, database connection string. After executing option 1, you can add all the secret that you need on key vault.

Prerequisites:

- Configure the Surveys application as described [here](./get-started.md).

> To create a key vault, you must use an account which can manage your Azure subscription. Also, any application that you authorize to read from the key vault must be registered in the same tenant as that account.

## Create Key Vault

- [Create a key vault using Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal#create-a-vault)

- Assign the Identity to access Key Vault. We are going to use [Manage Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/key-vault-configuration?view=aspnetcore-5.0#use-managed-identities-for-azure-resources)

  - Navigate the Key Vault
  - Navigate Access Policies
  - Add Access Policy
  - Select List and Get Secret
  - Select List and Get Certificate
  - Select principal
    - Running locally, the same account which you are log-in on Visual Studio
    - Running on App Service, the Object ID. The Object ID is shown in the Azure portal on the Identity panel of the App Service.
  - Save

## Option 1: Use client secret on key vault (And you can add another application secrets)

### Move the ClientSecret to key vault

- Create secret
  - Navigate Secret
  - Create secret
  - The secret name must be **AzureAd--ClientSecret**
  - Take the value from **ClientSecret** on the secret file configure when started the app [here](./get-started.md).
  - Delete the **ClientSecret** from the secret file, it is going to be on Key Vault now

### Change code

On Tailspin.Surveys.Web, Program.cs, the following code need to uncomment

```dotnetcli
.ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) =>
                {
                        var builtConfig = config.Build();
                        var secretClient = new SecretClient(
                            new Uri($"https://{builtConfig["KeyVaultName"]}.vault.azure.net/"),
                            new DefaultAzureCredential());
                        config.AddAzureKeyVault(secretClient, new KeyVaultSecretManager());
                });
```

On the app setting we need to configure the following value

```dotnetcli
 "KeyVaultName"
```

### Execute

The app must continue working on the same way, but now the secret is coming from Key Vault by Manage Identity  
You need to use the correct account on Visual Studio to have access by Manage Identity to Key Vault

## Option 2: Use certificate for Web App to prove the identity of the application, instead of using a client secret

[Here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/Using-certificates), we can find information about certificate using Microsoft Web Identity.  
ClientCertificates and ClientSecret are mutually exclusive. We need to start deleting ClientSecret from every where.

1. If you executed Option 1, please, delete secret from key vault
1. If you have ClientSecret on the secret file configure when started the app [here](./get-started.md), please, delete it.

### Create a Certificate on Key Vault

- Navigate Settings->Certificates
- Generate/Import
  - Certificate Name, it must be **MicrosoftIdentityCert**
  - For testing propose is enough _self-sign certificate_
  - Subject, _CN=Survey_
  - Press _Create_
- Select the created certificate
- Choose **Download in CER format** (It includes public key)

### Add Certificate on App Registration

- Go to Azure Active Directory
- Select App Registrations
- Select **Survey** app generated [here](./get-started.md)
- Select **Certificates & Secrets**
- Upload Certificate, and select the .cer file downloaded on the previous step

### Change code

On Tailspin.Surveys.Web,  _Manage User Secret_ Visual Studio option, add the ClientCertificates under AzureAd, you should get something [like](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/Certificates#describing-client-certificates-to-use-by-configuration) 

```dotnetcli
   "ClientCertificates": [
      {
        "SourceType": "KeyVault",
        "KeyVaultUrl": "https://msidentitywebsamples.vault.azure.net",
        "KeyVaultCertificateName": "MicrosoftIdentityCert"
      }
     ]
```
### Execute

The app must continue working on the same way, but now you are using a certificate from Key Vault.
